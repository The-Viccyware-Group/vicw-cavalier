# cavalier

This will maybe be a new Vector voice server implementation built from the ground-up to be able to run in the cloud rather than on a local device on the network.

This is mostly for my personal experiementation with firmwares below 1.2 which don't work with the latest vic-cloud code, so I can point them to a public cloud (as they require valid TLS certs).

Goals:

- Database storage (JSON storage an option as well)
- Accounts + working /v1/sessions
- Configs for different firmware versions
